-bpatel66-analysis:
	- analysis of the experiments conducted on both dataset

How to Run:
- You can run the Image-Segmentation and Voice-Classification Experiments with Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda3
- To run the AutoEncoder code you will need Anaconda2 because some of the libraries changed from 2 to 3
